Session 0

Computational designers are trying to drive value by implementing new digital ways of doing completing tasks. In session 0, groups were asked to discuss:

    Where have you been successful implementing digital workflows?
    Where haven't you been successful implementing digital workflows?
    How do you decide what/when to automate?
    How do you manage scope, i.e. decide when to draw the line?

The following answers were discussed
1.Where have you been successful implementing digital workflows?

    Tasks
    Areas where change is happening, or has to happen are good places to try and implement new practices. An example is when regulations have disrupted exiting paradigms, such as the new carbon requirements that are being introduced in Vancouver.
    It is important to be objective focused, and not worry about the tools. It's easy to get caught up in technology, but the output is the important thing. Some organizations won't care much about completing a design 20% faster, but will care about being able to complete a better design for similar effort.
    Showing people the result is useful when getting buy-in! There often isn't much use in talking about things in the abstract.
    Using a set of tools that people are familiar with will make it so that tools are more likely to be adopted. For example, BIM technicians may be more comfortable using rhino player than a scrip in grasshopper.
    There needs to be a baseline level of literacy about digital skill to see adoption of more advanced tool. Having a digital hiring standard is important so people are on the same level. This can be difficult in fields such as engineering however.
    Having someone in leadership as a champion is often very useful for pushing things forward.
    Having a successful example project is really useful for convincing people to implement digital practices in the future.

2.Where haven't you been successful implementing digital workflows?

    Firms are all developing their own piplines independently, and it's often difficult to collaborate outside of your organization.
    Collaboration between disciplines is also restricted for legal reasons. Currently it's not practical to share a grasshopper script. There are no standards for sharing digital models in a way that a 2D model could be shared!
    Getting adoption of tools within an organization is difficult in general
    When trying to get to fancy - some things just need to be brute forced by hand to meet deadlines.

3.How do you decide what/when to automate?

    Automate tasks that are DEFINITELY be repeated. It's very easy to spend a lot of time on something that is a one-off.
    If it's not possible to find people to do the task, i.e. if it's too boring, too dangerous, or two complex.
    keeping track of the data is useful if you want to implement machine learning

4.How do you manage scope, i.e. decide when to draw the line?

    Decide how deep into edge cases you want to go. It's
