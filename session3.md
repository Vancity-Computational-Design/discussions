# Session 3
Talk Topic: Open-source in the AEC Industry

Speaker: Callum Sykes

## Overview
In this talk, Callum reviewed his history as a developer in the AEC industry, where he started as an drafter, and is currently a product manager of Branch at Structurecraft.


## Benefits of Open-source
Some benefits of doing Opensource is that:
- People will give you free stuff..! In particular JetBrains will give you their IDE's for free if you are an opensource developer.
- It benefits everyone!
- It can increases trust in the product.
- Provides notoriety

## Doing Open-source on Your Own
The most important thing is to get started! Start a impossible task, and fail the whole way. It's okay to fail.
Where you can, start automating your job (but don't tell anyone when you've automated it).
In the AEC industry, there is a lot of space for automation, so many projects will be useful.
However, don't necessarily worry about. Make something that is useful to you, and put it out there. 
There is nothing that says each project needs to be the next best thing
Finally, it's recommended that you go to Hackathons, especially if you are a newer developer. You can get a lot of people.

## Open-source for Organizations.
There is can be resistance to open sourcing in an organization. People worry about giving away their “secret sauce” but there are many benefits
Remember that you don't have to opensource everything - you can take pieces of your project and opensource those.
When something is Open-sourced, other people will test your code for you. As the number of users grows, bugs will get caught quickly.
Opensource will also help give your organization a reputation of being on the cutting edge.

## Questions and Audience Discussion
The following notes arose from audience questions and discussion.

### On Automation in General
It always feels really hard to find time to automate things.
There is always a fire to put out, or a reason why not to do something now.
You might as well try and automate now.
The more you try and automate the better you'll get. If you never take that first step and try something you're not sure you can do, you'll never gain the skills in automation.
However, it's important to know your limits and not to get too stuck. Sometimes things just must be done now.

### On Prototypes
When you make a prototype, it should answer a question (see "wizard of oz prototyping")
Give people a tool and see how they react. Often times they will not use it in the expected way.
